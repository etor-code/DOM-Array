The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. it is a programming interface for web documents.
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated.
